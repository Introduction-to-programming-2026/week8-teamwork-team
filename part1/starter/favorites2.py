# favorites2.py
# Task: Print every language using csv.DictReader instead of csv.reader
#
# Key difference:
#   csv.reader  -> row is a LIST  -> access by index: row[1]
#   DictReader  -> row is a DICT  -> access by name:  row["language"]
#
# Bonus: DictReader automatically uses the first row as keys - no need for next()

import csv

with open("favorites.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row["language"])
